A group of Dorset breeders throughout the North of England and Scotland got together in the summer of 2011 and formed the Northern Dorset Breeders Club.

## Aims and aspirations of the club

* Promote the Dorset breed throughout the North of England and Scotland
* Support and encourage fellow breeders through sharing knowledge and skills
* Help breeders new to sheep keeping or the breed to establish and manage their flocks
* Gain more Dorset classes at agricultural shows and support them
* Encourage members to enter Any other Breed Classes at shows which do not hold classes specific to our breed
* Hold an annual club sale (2019 Gisburn Auction, Saturday 10th August) which is open to all dorset breeders to sell and to buy stock
* Hold social events such as a club dinner, farm walks, demonstrations etc.
* Encourage the inclusion of All Dorset Breeders resident in our Area
* Promote Poll Dorset & Dorset Horn Sheep at as many events and places as possible within and throughout our region
