# NDBC Chairman’s Christmas Newsletter

Hello All,

It appears that winter is finally here, but I don’t think we can complain too much after such a glorious summer. It has been a good year for members with many success’ at shows and sales and I’m sure that most of you have some future stars skipping round in what’s left of the grass!

There has been some fantastic events held by the club this year and hopefully next year will be even better. Many of our members have been approaching their local shows to try and get a Dorset class in the schedule with a great deal of success! We are going to try and put together a show diary so anyone with any show dates, please can you let me have them!!

Some fantastic news already for next year, we in the north are hosting the Society AGM, it is to be held at the Palace Hotel in Buxton, Derbyshire, a wonderful opportunity for our members to attend this Society event.

As some of you may already know Catherine Muncaster (Pritt) has resigned her post on the Society Council, we would like to thank her for her years of work representing the northern breeders. Thankfully her post has been filled by another of our members after Sam Driver was elected, congratulations to Sam who we are sure will do us proud!

We would also like to congratulate Sam, who has had a particularly successful year, having won best ‘Horned Exhibit’ at Mayfair before going on to scoop ‘Best Shepherded Flock’ in the Society flock competition, topping the NDBC flock competition and now has been awarded the David Matthews Award, well done Sam, we hope your success continues in 2015!!

Congratulations also to Karen Hodgson on the birth of her baby boy Harry, who was born in October, another budding new member!

The NSA’s Central Region Winter Fair will again be taking place at Bakewell Livestock Market, Derbyshire on the 29th Jan from 10am until 4.30pm. The Dorset Breed will be represented after the Society very kindly agreed to fund a stand. Edwin Pocock has very kindly volunteered to man the stand, as he has done in past years, thank you again Edwin, Helen Driver has also offered to assist and I’m sure they will do a Stirling job! Please take the time to stop by at what is a very informative event.

It is also that time of year again when membership is due for renewal, forms are attached for you to complete and fees remain the same.

We still need pictures of members sheep, thank you for the ones we have already received but a few more would be appreciated!

That’s it for this year! We hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and a successful new year!

Thank you ALL for your Support throughout 2014!
