**<u>SHOW AND SALE CONDITIONS</u>**

Registered stock (only) will be inspected for health, teeth and testicles between 9am and 10am. All registered sheep must therefore be penned by 9.30am.

Any registered animals which do not reach the inspection standard will not be eligible for the show or sale and must be removed from their pens immediately.

All sheep entered as registered must have their ears tattooed or tagged with the flock and individual numbers. These will be checked at the inspection and any not so identified will be deemed to be unregistered.

All vendors of MV accredited sheep must send a copy of the accreditation certificate with their entry forms. The relevant MV, pedigree and Genotype certificates must be handed in to the auctioneers prior to the sale.

All sheep must be lot numbered before entering the market.

**Show to commence at 11.00am.** All vendors are permitted to exhibit in the show classes. They are limited to two entries in each class which must be exhibitor bred and society registered.
