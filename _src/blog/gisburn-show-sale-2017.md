Saturday 12th August saw the Northern Dorset Breeders Club hold its first show and sale at Gisburn Auction Mart, Lancashire. The job of judging the pre-sale show was placed in the capable hands of club secretary and Treasurer Karen Hodgson of the Marren Flock, Cumbria. Her selection for overall champion was Sam Driver’s October ’16 born ram lamb, Sandy Lane Zebedee. Zebedee, who’s a grandson of the high indexed Downkillybegs Pilot, later sold for the day’s top price of 340gns to T. Weston, Chesterfield. Reserve Champion honours and Female champion went to Stuart Alderson’s Paddock Leach Flock with his October born ewe lamb. She also sold away to T. Weston, Chesterfield. Pens of ewe lambs topped at 180gns for Mrs Sheila Gray’s December born ewe lambs. The first prize pen of females, 5 Poll Dorset ewe hoggs from the Sandy Lane Flock sold away at 155gns. The sale enjoyed a total clearance of females but as with other years, ram trade was sticky.
The club would like to thank our auctioneer Rachel Capstick, Gisburn Auction and club members and exhibitors for making sure the first sale was a success.
