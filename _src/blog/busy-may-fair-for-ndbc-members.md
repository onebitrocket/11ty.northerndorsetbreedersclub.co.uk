# Busy May Fair for NDBC Members

![](/uploads/IMG_0039.jpg)

Tuesday 2nd May saw the Dorset Horn and Poll Dorset Sheep Breeders Association hold their annual May Fair at Exeter Market. As ever the event was well attended by Northern Club members.

In the pre-sale show, NDBC members performed well with James Royan’s Bennachie Zelda coming second in a strong class of ewe lambs. She sold the following day to club secretary Karen Hodgson for 500gns for her Marren flock. The reserve female champion of the day was awarded to Christina Johnson’s Bamburgh Z372. This smart ewe lamb had won the newly established Signet recorded female class, kindly sponsored by former club Chairman, Edwin Pocock. Sam Driver’s pen of shearling rams contained the 2nd Prize Horn Shearling, 5th Prize poll shearling and the 3rd Prize pair of shearling rams.

On sale day, club members were prolific as buyers and vendors. Three Poorton rams from Fooks Bros headed North. Purchasers were Thornbank Farms, Sheila Gray and Clare Gardiner who returned home with three quality rams. Club secretary Karen Hodgson also purchased the Female Champion, Pembroke Zara, exhibited by David Lewis, and her pen mate. Christina Johnson purchased Huish Zaki from the renowned Huish Flock of Mr David Rossiter. Society chairman James Royan purchased the much admired Sherborne Zodiac from R&amp;R Hole.

Club members sold well with total clearance. Sam Driver’s pen leader was the shearling ram Sandy Lane Xandy who sold for 800gns. Alistair Morton’s first time selling his Stobilee rams at May Fair saw his pen top at 600gns for Stobilee Zeus. James Royan’s Bennachie Zulu topped the Bennachie pen at 500gns.

Congratulations to all our members for a successful May Fair.
