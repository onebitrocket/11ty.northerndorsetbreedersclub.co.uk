# Club Update &#8211; Spring 2020

Due to the ongoing situation with Covid-19 the decision has been made to cancel the club open day on the 5th July at Thorney Bank Farm, Roughlee. We hope to reschedule this for later in the year dependant on social distancing guidelines. The club biannual flock competition will also be postponed till 2021.

There is the possibility that the Gisburn Show and Sale wonâ€™t be able to go ahead also. As a result of this, fully paid up members who have stock to sell can advertise their stock for free on the Facebook page and via the website. Any information and pictures etc can be emailed to sam.driver1@btinternet.com or to the secretary wasdaleheadhallfarm@hotmail.co.uk.
