A nice consignment of Poll Dorsets from Alec Steff’s Waggoner’s flock featured heavily in the prizes at the 84th Todmorden Agricultural Show. There was stiff competition from other Native Breeds including Suffolk, Hampshire Downs, Dorset Horns and Castle Milk Moorits. Congratulations also goes to Alec for taking the Interbreed Champion with an aged Texel ewe.
