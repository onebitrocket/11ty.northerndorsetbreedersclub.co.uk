**Judges Report – Mr Alec Steff (Waggoners)**

Ripley Show Sunday 11th August,

Ripley Castle Park

Harrogate

North Yorkshire

The show was held in a beautiful countryside setting with the Sheep Section accessed by a bridge (built in 1800) between two lakes.The sheep section was well supported with many different breeds and happily a separate Dorset Section.

The standard was very high with Brian and Cathryn Muncaster’s ram lamb “Downkillybegs Ultimo” a Ballytaggart Puma son a worthy Dorset Champion. Purchased at this years May Fair and carrying the Myomax Gene he has grown into a big, long upstanding Sire.

John and Sheila Gray’s homebred two shear ewe, out of a Blackhill sire and Huish dam, was a very close Reserve Champion.

Steward for the day was David Hullah, who was in good spirits and is now getting back into showing and hopes to be at Nidderdale in September, another show with dedicated Dorset Classes.
