# NBDC AGM 2017

Following the Gisburn sale we will be holding our AGM, this will be held at the Rendezvous Hotel in Skipton. Michael and Carol have kindly offered to house trailers overnight with any stock on board at their farm in Trawden. We are currently holding 14 rooms at the hotel at a rate of £65 per person dinner, bed and breakfast, there is a £25 supplement for a single room, if anyone wishes to just come to dinner the set menu will be £20 per head. We need to confirm numbers by the end of March, after that all rooms not booked will go back on general sale. A deposit of £20 per room is needed by the 15th of March please to secure your room.

We will be finishing off the weekend with a visit to the Crawshaw’s Farm on the Sunday. Here we will get the chance to see Michael and Carol’s sheep, which of course include Dorsets!! Thank you to Michael and Carol for offering to hold the event, I’m sure it will be another memorable day!
