# Christmas Newsletter

Dear Members

I hope this Newsletter finds all our members well? Despite this terrible weather!!! I‚Äôm sure some of you will be struggling with snow ‚òÉÔ∏èwhilst others will be up to their armpits in mud‚òîÔ∏èÔ∏è!!

I think it‚Äôs fair to say that it has been another successful year for both the club and its members. Mayfair, possibly the start of the breeding year saw many sheep from our region exhibited and sold successfully, members also had money to spend with many purchases probably already put to good use!!

The next event organised and boy did it take some organising was the southern trip! Members started off at David Rossiter‚Äôs Huish Flock, the sheep and the hospitality was second to none, the following day it was back on the bus to take in Francis Fooks‚Äô Poorton Flock and Rob Hole‚Äôs Sherborne Flock, again some amazing sheep and hospitality. That evening the club hosted a meal in the hotel to thank all who had been kind enough to allow us to visit them. The following morning it was off to Joe Larder‚Äôs Flock for some more exceptional sheep and hospitality before heading back to the north.

The following week the Great Yorkshire Show, this year judged by Thomas Wright, members took breed and reserve champion in the show classes, whilst Sam Driver reigned supreme in the club classes. A great show of sheep from members and record entries for the breed class.

This year also saw the return of the clubs Show and sale held at Gisburn Auction Mart. Sam Driver took overall champion with his ram lamb with Stuart Alderson taking reserve with his ewe lamb. Ram trade was pretty sticky, but there was 100% clearance with the females, everyone who sold was pleased with their trade.

That evening many members attended a meal at the Rendezvous Hotel, kindly arranged by Michael and Carol Crawshaw, the following day we held the AGM, again many thanks to Michael and Carol for hosting us and arranging a terrific guess the weight contest, the weather held out for us to view the Crawshaw‚Äôs Horned Dorsets and Herdwicks, another great day!

Looking forward to next year, we are hoping to bring you two sales, one north of the border and a second sale in the Lancashire/Yorkshire area, detail will be confirmed in the new year.

We will also see the return of the clubs bi-annual Flock competition which will be judged by Christina Johnson of the Bamburgh Flock, this will take place sometime within the first two weeks of August, again dates will be confirmed in the new year. I hope you will all take part, it is a really enjoyable event.

We have quite a lot of new members this year, so we would like to welcome them to the club, If anyone has any requests or ideas for other events we would be very interested to hear from you, especially our new members!! It would be great to get some of you more involved!!

Thank you to everyone that has helped make the club a success this year, your hard work is much appreciated!!

Finally I would like to take this opportunity to wish all our members a Merry Christmas and a happy and prosperous new year.

Thank you üòä
