# Summer Events 2017

To be able to make arrangements for these events we need interested parties to let Karen Hodgson or Alec Steff to know ASAP

**Scotland trip to James Royan’s Bennachie Flock**

***Proposed date – Early June***

Our first event is to be held at James Royan’s, this will probably be sometime around the beginning of June. Alec and James are finalising details and we will get back to you, it will be nice to have a trip over the border to the fabulous Scottish countryside! Anyone who is interested in attending please let me know.

**South of England Trip**

***Proposed Date – Late July***

After the success of previous years N.I trips, this year we are heading south and hoping to take in various flocks including David Rossiter’s Huish Flock. We are hoping to go towards the end of July, at present we need an idea of numbers, so if any of you would like to go please let me know and the we can calculate wether the trip is viable and what mode of transport will be best suited. The ones of you that went on the Northern Ireland trip will remember what a fabulous time we all had.

**NDBC AGM**

***Date – 12th &amp; 13th August***

Following the NDBC sale at Gisburn we will be holding our AGM, this will be held at the Rendezvous Hotel in Skipton. Michael and Carol Crawshaw have kindly offered to house trailers overnight with any stock on board at their farm in Trawden. We are currently holding 14 rooms at the hotel at a rate of £65 per person dinner, bed and breakfast, there is a £25 supplement for a single room, if anyone wishes to just come to dinner the set menu will be £20 per head. We need to confirm numbers by the end of March, after that all rooms not booked will go back on general sale. A deposit of £20 per room is needed by the 15th of March please to secure your room.

We will be finishing off the weekend with a visit to the Crawshaw’s Farm on the Sunday. Here we will get the chance to see Michael and Carol’s sheep, which of course include Dorsets!! Thank you to Michael and Carol for offering to hold the event, I’m sure it will be another memorable day!
